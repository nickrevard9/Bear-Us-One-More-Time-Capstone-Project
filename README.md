## Languages 
### Languages Chosen
- **React Native** – Frontend + Backend
    - Lots of documentation available 
    - Capable of working on multiple platforms – iOS and Android 
    - Based in JavaScript, which we are familiar with 
    - https://reactnative.dev/ 
- **NPM** – Package Manager 
    - We are familiar with it 
    - It is widely used in industry 
- **Expo SQLite** – Local Database  
    - Creating a relational database that persists on the phone 
    - We are familiar with SQL, which translates to SQLite 
    - No need for implementing backend currently 
    - [SQLite - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite/)

### Languages For Future Implementation
- **MySQL** – Database  
    - Not currently in use because we are using local storage on the mobile devices
- **Node JS** – Backend  
    - Keep coding base consistent language-wise 
    - Some members are familiar with it 
    - Current Baylor systems prevent the frontend from utilizing the backend API 

## Dependencies
- **NPM package manager** - Used for downloading packages for the expo application
- **Tamagui** - React Native library for cleaner UI
- **Expo Go** - Used for react native development and allows us to view the app while in development on our phones (or via Android emulator)
    - expo-router is used to layout the application pages like a stack
- **Metro Builder** - builds the application 
- Check the `package.json` page to view other dependent packages

### Using TamaGUI 

[TamaGUI](https://tamagui.dev/ui/intro) is a UI Library we have decided to use to help us with component styling. The following links help outline how to install and configure TamaGUI to work with ExpoGo and web applications. 

- Expo config for TamaGUI: https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/expo
- Metro (web) config for TamaGUI: https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/metro#web-support 

#### TamaGUI Config: your guide to style 

This config file allows you to set up a custom theme that you can use throughout the project. Now we can use colors defined under the labels “$background”, “$accentColor”, “$primary”, etc. All these custom tokens, fonts, and color schemes can be found in ‘tamagui.config.ts’.

## About Pawse
Hello! Welcome to Pawse, a media tracker app. Pawse is here to help track and quantify your everyday media consumption. This app offers both self-reporting and recommended entries based on your device’s screentime data. 

We hope, in the future, this app can be incorporated as a health app.
### App Features

#### Finished Application Features 
- Ability to log media usage 
- Ability to export media usage data as a CSV
- Viewing user data 
    - Daily View, Weekly View, and a Calendar View with charts analyzing their data 
- Gamification Features 
    - Streaks – like Duolingo, a user will get feedback when they log their first streak of the day 
    - Achievements – When a user logs enough types of media, they get an achievement 
- Daily, one-time notifications for Apple users 

#### Next Steps 
- Gamification Features 
    - Earning coins to shop for things on the app (decorating their profile) 
- Screen Time for both Android and iOS devices 
    - Both need developer builds 
- Developer Builds for future features and testing
- Notifications 
    - Improving the Notification center 
    - Retrieving push notifications and storing them in the center 
    - Android users need notifications implemented, but must have development build for this 
- User Interventions  
    - Implementing more of Dr. Tefertiller’s User Interventions as notifications 

## Developing the Application
See the `README.md` in `realapp/` for instructions on how to compile and run the Expo Go application.
